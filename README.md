# Welcome to GD32 Model Zoo

Here will provide some deep learning models that can be deployed on GD32 devices。These models have been optimized for GD32 and can run on GD32 devices with fewer memory requirements.This project has the following characteristics。

 - The peak memory usage of the model is adjustable
 - The provided model can be retrained
# Main features: Spatial separation model
